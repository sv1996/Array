/*
 Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to
  find that element whose value is equal to that of its index value.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N, size of array. 
The second line of each test case contains array elements.

Output:
Print the element whose value is equal to index value. 
Print "Not Found" when index value does not match with value.
Note: There can be more than one element in the array w
hich have same value as their index. You need to print every such element's index separated by a single space. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:
Input:
2
5
15 2 45 12 7
1
1

Output:
2
1
